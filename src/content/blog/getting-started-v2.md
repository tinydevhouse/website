The starter is a small Astro site. By the end of this post you will have your name on the home page, one real post, and a deploy that points to your domain.

Skip any step that does not apply.

<waffle>

This is a waffle block: a sanctioned place for the side thought, the caveat, the tiny argument with yourself, or the note that would otherwise make the main post sag.

Readers can turn these off. That keeps the main post direct without forcing the writing to become bloodless.

</waffle>

## Install

```bash
npm create astro@latest my-blog -- --template hanityx/astro-tone
cd my-blog
npm run dev
```

The dev server runs at `http://localhost:4321`. If the port is taken, Astro picks the next free one and prints it.

## Edit one config file

Open `astro-theme-config.ts`. This is the only file you need to touch for site-wide settings.

```ts
site: {
  url: 'https://your-site.com',
  base: '',
  title: 'Your Site',
  logoLabel: 'Tone',
  description: 'One short line about the site.',
  author: 'Your Name',
  defaultOgImage: '/og.png',
}
```

Three rules:

1. `url` is the production origin. Set `base` only when deploying under a subpath, such as GitHub Pages project sites.
2. `title` shows in the browser tab and in social previews.
3. `logoLabel` is the text in the header next to the home link. Keep it short — it sits in a 52px bar.

The other fields can wait.

## Know where things live

The starter keeps the public surface small. Most changes happen in one of these places:

```text
src/
  assets/             Demo images
  components/         Astro components
  content/blog/       Markdown and MDX posts
  layouts/            Shared layouts
  pages/              Routes
  scripts/            Client-side behavior
  styles/             Tokens, prose, page, layout, and shared behavior CSS
  ui.ts               Shared UI labels

LICENSE              License and third-party notices
```

Use `astro-theme-config.ts` first. Reach into `src/styles/` for site-level styles, prose, page layouts, and shared behavior. Reach into `src/components/` when component structure or component-owned styles need to change.

## Decide what the header shows

`nav` is empty by default. The logo links home, the theme toggle sits on the right, and that is it.

If you want header links:

```ts
nav: [
  { label: 'Blog', href: '/blog' },
  { label: 'About', href: '/about' },
],
```

Footer links live in `footerNav` and stay visible regardless. A quiet header with a useful footer is a fine combination.

## Write the first post

Posts live in `src/content/blog/`. The filename becomes the URL slug.

Create `src/content/blog/hello.md`:

```md
---
title: 'Hello'
description: 'A first post to test the layout.'
pubDate: '2026-05-01'
category: 'Notes'
---

This is the first paragraph. Start with a concrete note, a small decision, or one thing you want to remember.
```

Required: `title`, `description`, `pubDate`. Everything else is optional.

- `draft: true` keeps the post out of the build, the RSS feed, and the search index.
- `category` powers the filter row on `/blog`. Pick from `config.content.categoryOrder` or add a new one.
- `heroImage` is a relative path to a file inside `src/assets/`. It feeds cards, social metadata, and structured data; place the image in the Markdown body too when the post should show it inline.
- `homeHeroOrder: 1` pins a post into one of the two compact links at the top of the home page. Lower numbers appear first; unpinned posts fill any empty slots by publish date.
- `homeFeatured: true` pins one post to the large feature card on the home page.
- `homeOrder: 1` pins a post into the home page grid. Lower numbers appear first; unpinned posts fill any empty slots by publish date.
- `focusEffect: 'scroll-dark'` enables the optional scroll dark effect for that post. It turns on after the reader passes roughly the first 20% of the article body and restores the previous theme near the top. The trigger point is set by the theme; it is not section-specific.

## Replace the samples

The starter ships with sample posts to exercise the layout. Replace or delete them before you publish.

The fastest path:

1. Keep this guide if you find it useful.
2. Delete the others from `src/content/blog/`.
3. Add three or four of your own.

The blog index, RSS, related posts, and search update on the next build.

## Run the checks

Before deploying:

```bash
npm run check
npm run build
npm run preview
```

`check` runs Astro's type checks. `build` writes the static site and the Pagefind search index to `dist/`. `preview` serves the built output so you can click through it once.

If `check` fails, fix it before deploying. Type errors in the starter usually point at a missing field in `astro-theme-config.ts`.

## Deploy

Tone builds to `dist/`. Most hosts only need:

| Setting          | Value           |
| ---------------- | --------------- |
| Build command    | `npm run build` |
| Output directory | `dist`          |
| Node             | 22.12 or newer  |

Vercel, Netlify, and Cloudflare Pages all detect Astro automatically. Import the repository, accept the defaults, deploy.

After the first live deploy, set `site.url` in `astro-theme-config.ts` to the real domain and redeploy. Canonical links, RSS, sitemap, and social previews all depend on it.

If you deploy under a subpath such as `username.github.io/repo`, set `site.base` in `astro-theme-config.ts` before publishing. The Astro config reads that value for you.

The bundled GitHub Pages workflow sets `ASTRO_SITE_URL` and `ASTRO_SITE_BASE` automatically for project pages. For example, a repository named `my-blog` deploys with `/my-blog`; a user site repository named `username.github.io` deploys at the domain root.

## Enable comments (optional)

Comments are off by default. To turn on giscus:

1. Visit `https://giscus.app` and pick a repository with Discussions enabled.
2. Copy the four values it generates (`repo`, `repoId`, `category`, `categoryId`) into `config.comments.giscus`.
3. Set `config.comments.mode` to `giscus` for the original widget, or `giscus-custom` for the Tone-styled widget.

The component renders nothing until all four values are present. There is no half-enabled state.

## What to read next

- **Markdown You Will Actually Use** — the prose styles in one page.
- **Change the Look in One File** — color, spacing, type.
- **When to Reach for MDX** — using an Astro component inside a post.
